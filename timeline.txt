This is a timeline of i spent my time on this project, knowing only basic python and a little bit of openCV

Day-1:
    ->Looked up projects based on image recognition and analysis
    ->Drop the search due to complex requirements and start playing solitaire with some music
    ->EUREKA! SOLITAIRE!
    ->Search for any older projects of the same idea only to see this is not commonly used(NICE! A working challenge)
Day-2:
    ->Look into libraries i will need, begin by writing down onto physical paper the idea on mind
    ->the process being(very crudely): code screenshots the deck->recognises the deck components->plans next move-> executes the necessary move->repeat
    ->start by testing the screenshotting function, test the various ways of screenshotting, some testing with delay function to allow for tab switch
    ->Pull up courses on image recognition using python
Day-5:
    ->Get some idea on code and get to beginning the milestone on the project
    ->setup main.py
    ->setup capture folder
    ->realise i need to have data to work on, pull up solitaire and screenshot each card individually for a basic evaluation
    ->Take an ss of card back just in case.
